          The project goal is to develop a graphical user interface
          for programming a CPLD (Complex Programable Logics
          Device). The software is written in C++ and based on QT.  It
          will be available for Linux and Windows.
        </p>

        <p>
          The development team is 7 persons, all students of the
          University of Stuttgart, Germany. The project is part of our
          studies in Software Engineering. The output of the project
          is going to be used in conjunction with a hardware system
          called Offener Antrieb also developed at the University.
